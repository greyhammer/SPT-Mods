# SPT-Mods


This is the current running master copy of OZR mods for Single Player Tarkov

To use these mods, you must already have Single Player Tarkov installed and updated to the latest version.

Install: 
1. Download the latest SPT-Mods.vX.X.zip from here https://github.com/greyhammer/SPT-Mods/releases
2. extract contents
3. copy `BepInEx` and `user` folders to the Single Player Tarkov directory
4. Launch Single Player Tarkov like normal
5. Profit?? 

ALso, We made a script for launching the server and launcher in one click.
`SPT.bat` - you will need to edit the file and adjust the first 2 lines to point to your Single Player Tarkov folder.
After editing and saving, you can just double click that `SPT.bat` file
The server and launcher will start, after server window says happy playing, then refresh the launcher and it should connect.
